Leif is in this new world, the story goes, but to be placed here turning his back on his homeland can only bring ill tidings. Take, for example, the statue of the Swedish chronicler of the immigrant experience Vilhelm Moberg in Lindstrom, Minnesota. Moberg stands with his bike, but his head is turned east, toward home, as it should be. Until Erikson faces east, back toward Scandinavia, the Minnesota Vikings, named in honor of his people, will never win a Super Bowl.
